# Homebrew formula for trck.
#
# Lives here rather than in a tap so the version bump is one commit in one repo; a tap
# consumes this file. Point one at it with:
#
#   brew tap leonkacowicz/trck https://github.com/leonkacowicz/trck
#   brew install leonkacowicz/trck/trck
#
# The `url`/`sha256` pairs are updated by the release workflow's publish step. Building
# from source is the fallback, and costs nothing to support: the crate has no
# dependencies, so `cargo build` needs no network beyond the tarball itself.
